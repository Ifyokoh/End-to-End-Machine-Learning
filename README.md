# End-to-End-Machine-Learning

## Project Motivation
The aim of the project is to build an end to end machine learning project. Create a Python package, collect dataset using data scraping technique, train model and deploy it

## To use the package in your notebook:
```python
!pip install propertypro-scrapper==1.1.0

from propertypro.propertypro import Propertypro

scraper = Propertypro()

scraper.scrape_data(100, ["enugu"])
